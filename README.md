*ITP Spring 2020*

## Portfolio - Week 0
From the work I've done in ITP, three projects are important to me regarding the concepts and techniques I merged.

### Generative Major Arcana
This project is an exploration of how IA algorithms generate random patterns based on a dataset –in this case of images– and how this outcome can be assigned with meanind by the association with already known symbols. In this project I gathered a dataset of Major Arcana cards scraped from Google Images and used them to train a a DCGAN model, that was run to generate *new cards*.

Further information on this project can be found on its complete [documentation](https://github.com/guillemontecinos/itp_spring_2019_electronic_rituals/blob/master/meditation_2/meditation_2.md).

### sonAR
This project may be the starting point of my thesis. It is an AR spatial sound app in which physical elements can be spawned in space and react to the ambient sound as well as act as sound sources. This project attempted to explore how users can interact with sound elements that exist in an intermediate layer between the real world and our perception.

Further information of this project can be found on its [documentation](https://guillemontecinos.cl/portfolio/sonar/).

### Dead Man Walking
This project was my first AR production using Unity. In this project I learned the foundations of AR in Unity and its limitations, and I also learned how to develop a storytelling-based experience using XR technologies. Please check out my [portfolio page](https://guillemontecinos.cl/portfolio/dead-man-walking/) for further information.

## Ideation - Week 1
### Mind-map and question
During the first week we were commited to think about our thesis topic and develop some exercises based on it. The first exercise we were asked to do was to write a mind map that connected all conecpts related to our topic, and that would allow us to write a research question. The concept I picked to develop the map was *Reality*, since I have had lots of troubles with experiencing the political process of Chile through the media, specially the media options offered by the mobile phone and laptop. In this sence, the idea of reality collapses because my current reality, NYC, is oppossed to Chile's reality, that I see *experience* mediated. Becasue of the above, I built the following mind-map:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/guillemontecinos/itp_spring_2020_thesis/blob/master/assets/reality-mind-map.jpg" align="middle" width="80%">
</p>

When thinking about reality I observed there are a couple important relations that can be built from it, like what kind of reality are we talking about: physical, mental, political, visual, snesorial, or affective (emotional). When experiencing a process of political change through media, like the one I'm witnessing in Chile, it is easy to mistake what is real. Even though the receiver –in this case, me– knows the images come from an event that is taking place thousand of kilometers away, the sensations those images provoke can change mood and therefhore how they perceive reality. TV –like [Galería Cima](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4GOcOKkEefz5NamN4WyMFg/videos), which is a 24 hr youtube streaming from the main center of demonstrations in Chile– and independent media in social platforms like Instagram or Facebook becomes holograms that build pieces of immaterial reality or portals from our living room to Santiago. 

Jean Baudrillard in his book *Simulacra and Simulation* says about *holograms*: 
> The TV studio transforms you into holographic characters: one has the impression of being materialized in space by the light of projectors, like translucid characters who pass through the masses (that of millions of TV viewers) exactly as your real hand passes through the unreal hologram without encountering any resistance–but not without concequences: having passed through the hologram has rendered your hand unreal as well *(p. 105)*.

The topic is too broad, and I have no understanding yet to destillate it into only one question. So instead of trying to find the question that would guide my research I decided to exercise writting a bunch of questions, starting from a general query to a more specific one, in order to walk through my ideas towards a few questions that could represent my topics of interets. The following questions are arranged in two tables but don't follow any specific pattern nor logic:

#### First set of questions
|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
| Day dreaming                                                          | Where reality becomes real?                                               | Can something be my reality –or can I be part of its reality– only because I imagined it? |
| Scrolling down the Instagram feed                                     | In the space outside our bodies?                                              | Are dreams part of reality even though theay are not real? |
| Santiag/Plaza de la Dignidad faded out                                | In the boundary between our body and the space?                               | Does it make senes to talk about what is real or what is not? |
| It is not there because i am not there                                | Or inside our minds?                                                          | Is Santiago still located at -33.437º, -70,634º even I don't see it throught my eyes? |
| Doesn't exist because I don't experience it                           | Can reality be more than only one?                                            | Can be my sister and parents lying to me and faking Santiago is still there? |
| I live a simulation of that reality that I imagine and scroll down    | Can many realities coexist in the same time/space?                            | Is it possible that Google Maps creates a new instance of the class 'Santiago' every time I click on it in the browser? |
|                                                                       | Is the moon's landscape my reality while I live in NYC?                       | |
|                                                                       | Can it be my reality if I have no emotional connections nor memories of it?   | |

#### Second set of questions
|   |   |
|---|---|
| Is a country's political organization real? or are we in a simulacrum of politcal order? | Is capitalism real becaus it governs the space we move in or because it governs the realationships between our ideas inside our minds? |
| Do we perform everyday that we are citizens and belong to a super-structure that governs us? | Does capitalism exist in the layer when our body ends and the outer space begins? |
| Can be a new constitution real? | Can capitalism exist in an infinitesimal layer between two bodies? |
| Is the current constitution real? | If capitalism cannot survive between two bodies, why can it exist in a society? |
| Are the powers that co-opt us real? | Are we a society? |
| Is the police real? | Are we connected and aggloremated by invisible forces like magnetism? |
| Are police men and women simulating they detent a power given by the society? | Who can ensure me that all this is not a simulacrum without pointing out movies like the matrix and inception? |
| Is that society even real? | |
| Is capitalism real? | |
| Is capitalism realism real? | |

### Spectulative designs
For this exerciese I'll take the question ***Where reality becomes real?*** as a resarch question. It addresses the physical dimension of reality, that related to the space we inhabit and which is conceived in our minds as a logical representation of cartesian coordinates and vectors, whilst is experienced from the physicality of our body. The question presupposes we have no certainty the reality we assume as real is real, we the speculative designs should consider it.

This set of mindful procedures guide all the aspects of everyday life. By following these good practices should practices in order to be aware and avoid buy a fake reality as a real reality.

## Ideation - Week 2

During this week I wanted to address some of the questions I've had in the back of my head during the last few weeks, some of them –that I wrote during class' 2 exercise– are: *can reality be composed by all realities at the same time?*, *can internet reproduce multiple realities at the same time?*, and *can different time realities –or time scales– occur simultaneously in one reality?*. As it can be seen, these questions set the focus on two aspects of reality: **time** –the non-spatial continuum in which events occur in apparently irreversible succession [(1)](https://www.wordnik.com/words/time), in which existence is measured, or the past, present, and future considered as a whole. [(2)](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/time)– and **the internet**. The idea of questioning internet's role on the mediation of our reality –wether it is by the overflow of content through social media and news broadcast services, or simply because it calls our attention, abstracting us from our reality– popped up after reading an [article](https://www.wired.com/story/mirrorworld-ar-next-big-tech-platform/) published by Wired that talks about the *mirrorworld*. 

The *mirrorworld*, according to the publication, is a digital mapping of the real world where every element has its own 3D twin, from streets to animals to people. It is pretty much the materialization –ironically within internet's immaterial environment– of the idea of hyperreality proposed by Baudrillard –inspired in Borges' *On Exactitude in Science* fable–: a 3D simulacrum of the world on real scale with detailed enough quality to feed 3D engines in real time for augmentation or synthesis of realities. Since the internet stores –and thus, contains– all realities fed to it, the *mirrorworld* can also be all realities at the same time, like a [hypercube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube) –geometrically speaking– or like Borges' Library of Babel. In this regard a story linearly narrated built on time is not linear anymore, because multiple stories happen on space and time simultaneously, thus we can speak of a *hypercube of realities*.

### Weekly experiment: 4 days out of social media
Based on the aforementioned reasons I designed an experiment that consisted on taking myself out of any social media application, chat service or streaming service that could affect my perception of reality, for four days. The criteria I set to choose which environments I was going to get rid off was: if the app took enough of my time so I considered it isolating me from my reality, or if it flooded me with high amounts of information from other reality –in this case, Chile. Because of that, I removed all the chat apps I was using at the time (WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal), plus Instagram and Spotify. I kept Google services because I personally don't feel they take enough time from me, and also because I needed to keep connected to my network for work. The goal of the experiment was to –while being out of the network– qualitatively evaluate how these information media could affect my perception of reality.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/guillemontecinos/itp_spring_2020_thesis/blob/master/assets/erasing-apps.gif" align="middle" width="30%">
</p>

The experiment period coincided with a very strong cold I got last week that had me three days in bed –this is an important fact because affected considerably the conditions of the test. The first day out of social media wasn't different enough from a *normal* day: even though I didn't have in my phone the apps I use to open every five minutes, I didn't miss them yet because I was aware this was an experiment. So I spent most of my time reading and watching bulk YouTube videos.

The fact of being sick and isolated in my bedroom took more relevance during the second and third day of the experiment, when I got more bored and felt more isolated. I didn't have WhatsApp to tell my family about my sickness, or to talk with my friend about the football match we were probably watching at the same time, nor had Instagram to scroll down to the infinity content I didn't care about. Besides, it has to be stated that even though I erased the aforementioned apps, while facing the necessity of communicating with my family and friends, and keeping track of Chile's situation, I found my way to evade the experiment's restrictions: I visited traditional media in the second case and used iMessage in the first one.

What I noticed during the experiment –besides the fact that we always can find the way to keep connected to the network– is that **the shape information takes on social media doesn't makes me feel comfortable**. Focusing on Instagram, I use it when I feel the necessity of evading boredom by scrolling down my feed or by swiping right others' stories. But as I said before, I don't want to consume all the content I do when getting into the app, even though I voluntarily followed every profile. What I don't like of all this is the way we have been taught to consume content: Instagram's logic –and so all social media apps– is to overflow our screens with information, by creating this sensation of infinite or boundless box of events that *might* be interesting to us. I argue that this architecture of information broadcast is invasive because its goal is to persuade the user to keep consuming –i.e., to resign their will of quitting the app– and by this means smuggling adds of third parties.

But what does it have to do with reality? A lot. For example, I follow a ton of Instagram accounts based on Chile, many of them created to inform about the current social situation. On a normal day I spent at least a couple hours watching what is happening in my country on real time. This creates in my consciousness the sensation of empathy with the ones affected by –for example– police violence, but also creates the necessity to do something about it. By doing so, my mind tends to dissociate from the environment I'm in and also the duties I'm working on, and tends to make me feel in a state of limbo in which I feel totally disconnected from where I am and what I'm doing here. This state of disconnection with my reality –because of a connection with a simulation of Chile's reality– affects my perception of reality in the moment and space I inhabit (the right here, right now I guess). This is not because I disapprove being aware of Chile's situation, on the contrary, it's because the excessive amount of awareness I have towards it, when mediated by social media algorithms, disrupts my perception of reality.

On the other hand, I usually spend a lot of time consuming social media (most of us do). Time flies when scrolling down on Instagram! The perception that time shrinks when consuming social media and expands when contemplating a natural landscape is real, and is something I'd like to research next week. During the experiment I felt days were considerably longer and the clock ticked slower than usual. This of course was mediated by the fact of being ill and also probably because of my lighter work load in comparison to previous semesters, but I think the reason of feeling time's pass longer or shorter depends directly on how aware we are of its presence. Last week I had time to be aware of time, situation we are not usually exposed to on our everyday life.

Inspired on the reflections I got from the experiment, I'd like to spend next week researching about the idea of time and how perception of reality is affected by this concept. Now the question *can different time realities –or time scales– occur simultaneously in one reality?* takes relevance and can be used as a guide for next week's explorations.

Feedback from Aidan:
> "I argue that this architecture of information broadcast is invasive because its goal is to persuade the user to keep consuming –i.e., to resign their will of quitting the app– and by this means smuggling adds of third parties." --> this seems like an important understanding!  I think the focus on time-scales is a great way to explore different, simultaneous realities.  On a very basic level, different academic disciplines think  on different time-scales (dance --> sociology --> history --> geology).  I wonder if there are individuals who actually experience these different time scales in a more visceral (non-intellectual) way.  Does activism generate a sense of immediacy?  What brings about a longer time-scale?  Spiritual work?   I don't know....  Excited to see how you experiment with this!

Feedback from Gabe:

> What sort of active experiments could you come up with that would explore your question of whether different time realities could occur simultaneously in one reality?

> It seems that there are many different scales of time already in our own reality? https://taeyoonchoi.com/2015/08/in-search-of-personalized-time/

## Thesis Statement - Week 3

### Deformed Realities – A critical approach to the effect of technologies in human perception of reality
My thesis research addresses the idea of reality, represented by the tension between time and virtual space, and how it is mediated in our everyday life by our relationship with technology, particularly internet and social media.

I am interested in this topic because I have had lots of trouble with experiencing the political process of Chile through social media, specifically Instagram. In this medium, a simulacrum of my country’s reality is broadcasted to me creating a tension between home’s current context and the environment I live in, undermining the idea of reality. This affects my perception of reality because Instagram overflows my phone with content I don’t necessarily want to consume, and the large amounts of time spent on this deform my perception of time and space.

It will be a series of pieces that inquiry about the meaning of reality in our technology-mediated time.

#### Research Plan/Approach
My research plan for the rest of the semester consists in a short review around the concept of time and how humans perceive it, and a experiment-based research of the tension between time and virtual space in the mediation of reality by technologies like the mobile phone, mixed realities and social media. This practical research will consist in a series of experiments presented as artistic artwork, carried out in different mediums and formats, mostly using technologies such as AR, VR, computer vision, sound processing and machine learning.

#### Research summary
My research firstly addressed the role of Augmented Reality in the mediation and perception of space. For this, it was studied how humans perceive space, what has been the role of technology in the production of space during time, and what are the biases inherited in the reproduction of space by 3D engines.

Then, it was inquired what is reality and how technology (particularly social media) affects our perception of it, what is simulation and how every species’ umwelt affect their understanding of time and space. Time and virtual space appear as the most relevant representations of reality to be explored during this process.

### Implementation
#### Relevant experience
I don’t precisely know what technologies I’m going to use yet, but I guess my work will be mostly digital or at least coding-based. I’m pretty sure my thesis will not involve high complexity fabrication skills. I have pretty good experience coding in languages as JS, C++ and C#, which would facilitate my work if I develop web-based pieces, or use tools such as Unity or openFrameworks. I might be using shaders at some point, which I don’t have experience with, but I’ll try to keep it simple in order not to spend too much time on learning it.

#### Knowns & Unknowns
The main goal during my thesis is to focus primarily on the artistic development of the idea more than the technical complexity of it. This means, I want the technical implementation of the project to be at the service of the concept, and not the concept to be built around certain technology. In this sense, there is no particular problem to solve since I haven’t chosen the mediums I am going to use yet.

#### Implementation plan
* Week 4 - 7: Keep carrying on theoretical research between now and the midterm.
* Week 4 - 7: Develop 3 artistic experiments that address the concept described between now and the midterm.
* Week 7 - 8: After the midterm, and considering the feedback given, evaluate which of the experiments better frame my concept (if any) and use it as a base to develop a bigger piece that encloses the whole idea of my research. If the feedback given is negative in that regard, re-frame my concepts and develop one or two new experiments that could end being my final project.
* Weeks 8 - 11: Fabricate the last version of my thesis project(s).
* Week 11: User testing & documenting.

## Ideation - Week 3
By the end of this week, as a means to ground my ideas I carried out an *exquisite corpse* exercise. A madlib-based [exquisite corpse](https://github.com/guillemontecinos/itp_spring_2020_thesis/blob/master/week_4/exquisite_corpse.js) exercise was run to generate [40 random prompts](https://github.com/guillemontecinos/itp_spring_2020_thesis/blob/master/week_4/good_results.md) based on concepts I've addressed during my ideation process.

Curated Results:

1. My thesis criticizes the internet through a/an [post-human] digital collection. Components: maps & thread (1) 
2. My thesis simulates scrolling down through a/an aesthetic video art. Components: mobile phone & projector (4) 
3. My thesis tensions mental space through a/an metaphoric [recursive] sound [audiovisual] installation. Components: microphone & maps (22)
4. My thesis criticizes national identity through a/an metaphoric video art. Components: sand & paper (27)
5. My thesis tensions violence [on the internet] through a/an expressive sculpture. Components: AR filter & paint (15)
6. My thesis deconstructs hallucination through a/an metaphoric data visualization. Components: whatsapp stickers & headphones (40)

## Experiment 1 - Week 4
The first experiment of this series started with the following promtp:
> My thesis tensions mental space through a/an metaphoric [recursive] sound [audiovisual] installation. Components: microphone & maps.

The development of the exercise started with some questions: 
* How to represent the mental space?
  * The mental space is an abstraction of the physical world
  * Is logic-based
  * Built from and conditioned by our experience regarding the space
  * Conditioned by our political and religious stands
* How mental space gets in tension with the actual physical space?
  * Maps are representations of the space
  * Then, mental space might conditioned by maps
* How to connect places that are not contiguous in physical space but blur into each other in our mental spaces? Like in Radiohead's [Daydreaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTAU7lLDZYU)
* How to capture one's experience on physical space?
  * Is personal positional data a good way of representing it?
* In my personal case, my bedroom in Santiago is one step away from mine in Brooklyn. When falling asleep I can trabel instantly from one place to another. Space blurs and reality too.
* Social media can be another way of mapping information.

Based in all this notes I took, I developed the following mindmap:
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/guillemontecinos/itp_spring_2020_thesis/blob/master/assets/experiment-1-mindmap.jpeg" align="middle" width="80%">
</p>


A great referent to this project is The Coigïtum, a painting by the chilean painter [Roberto Matta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Matta) that –in my understanding– represents a whole world. Different non-human shapes spread in the space represent different moments or emotions from an unreal world. Even though all the elements don't fit with my visual knowledge, the composition makes me feel all of them interact in an organic tension of relationships.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pwrhMhA6AqM/Tsp5Ah0lpHI/AAAAAAAAECw/KLg0Zjyc9sQ/s1600/coigitum.jpg" align="middle" width="80%">
</p>

This painting seems to me to be a good representation of a mental space, understing it like the mind representation of all the phyisical spaces we have affinity with, where very distant and unrelated spaces blur one into another, mapping emotional links aming the space.

An approach to create a prototype based on this prompt is to build a 3D sculpture which represents my mental space by placing in the same site physical representations of miningful locations regarding my experience. In this sense, the first I did was to take the painting and setting it as a 360 image, as a way of exploring the transition from 2D to 3D. It's interesting how the piece makes sense as a volumetric image, which talks about it was probably designed as an immersive world.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/guillemontecinos/itp_spring_2020_thesis/blob/master/assets/coigitum-360.gif" align="middle" width="80%">
</p>

Then I explored how to take 2D panoramas and play with their volumetric essence. Even thoug 360 images are ment to be displayed as a sphere that represents space, we can also take the equirectangular images and deform them in order to create a sensation of physicality but also to blur them. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/guillemontecinos/itp_spring_2020_thesis/blob/master/experiment-1/documentation/troutman-panorama-deformed-1.png" align="middle" width="80%">
</p>

After experimentig with it I realized I'm still missing some connections in this idea, what kind of input the piece takes to map the different locations to the representation of mental space? or what is the output I expect to have? Because of this, I decided to pause this experiment and move forward with another one.

## Thesis Statement (Reiteration) - Week 4

### Deformed Realities
My thesis research addresses the idea of reality and how its perception is mediated and deformed when interacting with technology. Some interactions I’m interested in are scrolling down on social media, surfing Google Maps or going through an immersive experience on Mixed Realities in consideration on how affect perception of time and space.

I got interested in this topic after witnessing the current political process in Chile through social media: a simulacrum of my country’s reality was broadcasted to me, tensioning the relationship with the environment I live in and altering the idea of reality. Starting from this experience I formulated the following research question: how spatial and temporal realities are mapped by different platforms and techniques, like Google Maps, Instagram, or Mixed Realities? and how that construction can be aligned, in tension or in correlation with one’s mental space?

It will be a series of three pieces that inquiry about our relationship with technology and how it mediates and deforms our perception of reality. At this point I have clarity of two of the three pieces: one of them will explore the tension between our mental space and how it is built as an abstraction of the physical space. How emotions and our spatial experience affect this process? how our mental space is built and how maps, social media and the internet mediate this process? A second piece will use the gesture of scrolling down a screen as a metaphor of our relationship with social media and how it affects our perception of time and space.

### Research

#### Research Plan/Approach
My research for the rest of the semester consists of the development of a series of practical experiments presented as artistic artwork. These experiments will be carried out in different mediums and formats, mostly using technologies such as AR, VR, computer vision, sound processing and machine learning. Through them I will explore the relationship between perception of temporal and spatial reality and the usage of technology such as mobile phones, the internet, social media, and Mixed Reality.

#### Research summary
My research firstly addressed the role of Augmented Reality in the mediation and perception of space. For this, it was studied how humans perceive space, what has been the role of technology in the production of space during time, and what are the biases inherited in the reproduction of space by 3D engines.

Then, it was inquired what is reality and how technology (particularly social media) affects our perception of it, what is simulation and how every species’ umwelt affect their understanding of time and space. Time and virtual space appear as the most relevant representations of reality to be explored during this process.

I need to carry out some more research regarding the effects of the internet and social media usage in the process of perception of time and space, in order to better frame the strategies I will take to create artistic work based on my research. This research will be brief and focused on the works I will develop during the rest of the semester.

### Implementation
#### Relevant experience
I have pretty good experience coding in languages as JS, C++ and C#, which would facilitate my work if I develop web-based pieces, or use tools such as Unity or openFrameworks. I might be using shaders at some point, which I don’t have experience with, but I’ll try to keep it simple in order not to spend too much time on learning it.

#### Knowns & Unknowns
The first of the experiments I will carry out implies the design of a system that displays a infinite scroll website in a mobile phone, senses the scrolling speed and sends it to a server. Then the server forwards the data to an openFrameworks app that will simulate the deformation of the space around the user. This prototype requires the use of HTML, JavaScript, Node.js, Web Sockets, OSC and C++.

The second experiment will imply the manipulation of cartographic data that will be used to retrieve 2D and 3D graphics from Google Maps and use them to speculatively represent the mental space of a person, in Unity. This prototype requires the use of JS, GIZ and C#. The knowledge related to cartography, maps and mapping will be acquired in the class All Maps Lie, during the second half of the semester.

## Experiment 2 - Week 5
My second experiment consists in an installation that speaks about getting lost in social media by exploring the gesture of scrolling down as a mind state in which reality blurs around the subject, while consuming a reality curated by a third party. The concept of this piece starts from my personal experience of witnessing Chile's social uprising through Instagram's mediation. This medium has broadcasted to me every Friday's protest since October 18th, police brutality and the current stat of the city after four months of protests. The installation talks about the sensation of getting lost in time and space when experiencing other reality in social media, using the scroll down gesture as a metaphor of loosing awareness of one's soroundings but also as an interactive interface.

process of infinite scroll

I wanted ro set an infinite scroll that added nth-child `<div>` elements when the scrolling bar reached the end of the screen. 

At the same time I pursued to measure the scroll speed by setting an event listener attaced to the DOM element `document.body`. This solution didn't work properly becasue, as the document moved up, the touch event traveled on the screen with the event, so the point of reference was moving with the touch. As a consequence of this, the swipe gesture couldn't be measured.

To solve this I decided tojust send the timestamp of every time a new `<div>` was appended to the document.
