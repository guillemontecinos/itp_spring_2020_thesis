## Portfolio - Week 0
From the work I've done in ITP, three projects are important to me regarding the concepts and techniques I merged.

### Generative Major Arcana
This project is an exploration of how IA algorithms generate random patterns based on a dataset –in this case of images– and how this outcome can be assigned with meanind by the association with already known symbols. In this project I gathered a dataset of Major Arcana cards scraped from Google Images and used them to train a a DCGAN model, that was run to generate *new cards*.

Further information on this project can be found on its complete [documentation](https://github.com/guillemontecinos/itp_spring_2019_electronic_rituals/blob/master/meditation_2/meditation_2.md).

### sonAR
This project may be the starting point of my thesis. It is an AR spatial sound app in which physical elements can be spawned in space and react to the ambient sound as well as act as sound sources. This project attempted to explore how users can interact with sound elements that exist in an intermediate layer between the real world and our perception.

Further information of this project can be found on its [documentation](https://guillemontecinos.cl/portfolio/sonar/).

### Dead Man Walking
This project was my first AR production using Unity. In this project I learned the foundations of AR in Unity and its limitations, and I also learned how to develop a storytelling-based experience using XR technologies. Please check out my [portfolio page](https://guillemontecinos.cl/portfolio/dead-man-walking/) for further information.

## Ideation - Week 1
### Mind-map and question
During the first week we were commited to think about our thesis topic and develop some exercises based on it. The first exercise we were asked to do was to write a mind map that connected all conecpts related to our topic, and that would allow us to write a reearch question. The concept I picked to develop the map was *Reality*, since I have had lots of troubles with it since I've been experiencing the political process of Chile through the different media options offered by my mobile phone and laptop. In this sence, the idea of reality collapses because my current reality, NYC, is oppossed to Chile's reality, that I see *experience* mediated. Becasue of the above, I built the following mind-map:
