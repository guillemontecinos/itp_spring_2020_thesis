*Guillermo Montecinos*

*ITP Spring 2020*

## Portfolio - Week 0
From the work I've done in ITP, three projects are important to me regarding the concepts and techniques I merged.

### Generative Major Arcana
This project is an exploration of how IA algorithms generate random patterns based on a dataset –in this case of images– and how this outcome can be assigned with meanind by the association with already known symbols. In this project I gathered a dataset of Major Arcana cards scraped from Google Images and used them to train a a DCGAN model, that was run to generate *new cards*.

Further information on this project can be found on its complete [documentation](https://github.com/guillemontecinos/itp_spring_2019_electronic_rituals/blob/master/meditation_2/meditation_2.md).

### sonAR
This project may be the starting point of my thesis. It is an AR spatial sound app in which physical elements can be spawned in space and react to the ambient sound as well as act as sound sources. This project attempted to explore how users can interact with sound elements that exist in an intermediate layer between the real world and our perception.

Further information of this project can be found on its [documentation](https://guillemontecinos.cl/portfolio/sonar/).

### Dead Man Walking
This project was my first AR production using Unity. In this project I learned the foundations of AR in Unity and its limitations, and I also learned how to develop a storytelling-based experience using XR technologies. Please check out my [portfolio page](https://guillemontecinos.cl/portfolio/dead-man-walking/) for further information.

## Ideation - Week 1
### Mind-map and question
During the first week we were commited to think about our thesis topic and develop some exercises based on it. The first exercise we were asked to do was to write a mind map that connected all conecpts related to our topic, and that would allow us to write a research question. The concept I picked to develop the map was *Reality*, since I have had lots of troubles with experiencing the political process of Chile through the media, specially the media options offered by the mobile phone and laptop. In this sence, the idea of reality collapses because my current reality, NYC, is oppossed to Chile's reality, that I see *experience* mediated. Becasue of the above, I built the following mind-map:

<p align="center">

</p>

When thinking about reality I observed there are a couple important relations that can be built from it, like what kind of reality are we talking about: physical, mental, political, visual, snesorial, or affective (emotional). When experiencing a process of political change through media, like the one I'm witnessing in Chile, it is easy to mistake what is real. Even though the receiver –in this case, me– knows the images come from an event that is taking place thousand of kilometers away, the sensations those images provoke can change mood and therefhore how they perceive reality. TV –like [Galería Cima](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4GOcOKkEefz5NamN4WyMFg/videos), which is a 24 hr youtube streaming from the main center of demonstrations in Chile– and independent media in social platforms like Instagram or Facebook becomes holograms that build pieces of immaterial reality or portals from our living room to Santiago. 

Jean Baudrillard in his book *Simulacra and Simulation* says about *holograms*: 
> The TV studio transforms you into holographic characters: one has the impression of being materialized in space by the light of projectors, like translucid characters who pass through the masses (that of millions of TV viewers) exactly as your real hand passes through the unreal hologram without encountering any resistance–but not without concequences: having passed through the hologram has rendered your hand unreal as well *(p. 105)*.

The topic is too broad, and I have no understanding yet to destillate it into only one question. So instead of trying to find the question that would guide my research I decided to exercise writting a bunch of questions, starting from a general query to a more specific one, in order to walk through my ideas towards a few questions that could represent my topics of interets. The following questions are arranged in two tables but don't follow any specific pattern nor logic:

#### First set of questions
|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
| Day dreaming                                                          | Where reality becomes real?                                               | Can something be my reality –or can I be part of its reality– only because I imagined it? |
| Scrolling down the Instagram feed                                     | In the space outside our bodies?                                              | Are dreams part of reality even though theay are not real? |
| Santiag/Plaza de la Dignidad faded out                                | In the boundary between our body and the space?                               | Does it make senes to talk about what is real or what is not? |
| It is not there because i am not there                                | Or inside our minds?                                                          | Is Santiago still located at -33.437º, -70,634º even I don't see it throught my eyes? |
| Doesn't exist because I don't experience it                           | Can reality be more than only one?                                            | Can be my sister and parents lying to me and faking Santiago is still there? |
| I live a simulation of that reality that I imagine and scroll down    | Can many realities coexist in the same time/space?                            | Is it possible that Google Maps creates a new instance of the class 'Santiago' every time I click on it in the browser? |
|                                                                       | Is the moon's landscape my reality while I live in NYC?                       | |
|                                                                       | Can it be my reality if I have no emotional connections nor memories of it?   | |

#### Second set of questions
|   |   |
|---|---|
| Is a country's political organization real? or are we in a simulacrum of politcal order? | Is capitalism real becaus it governs the space we move in or because it governs the realationships between our ideas inside our minds? |
| Do we perform everyday that we are citizens and belong to a super-structure that governs us? | Does capitalism exist in the layer when our body ends and the outer space begins? |
| Can be a new constitution real? | Can capitalism exist in an infinitesimal layer between two bodies? |
| Is the current constitution real? | If capitalism cannot survive between two bodies, why can it exist in a society? |
| Are the powers that co-opt us real? | Are we a society? |
| Is the police real? | Are we connected and aggloremated by invisible forces like magnetism? |
| Are police men and women simulating they detent a power given by the society? | Who can ensure me that all this is not a simulacrum without pointing out movies like the matrix and inception? |
| Is that society even real? | |
| Is capitalism real? | |
| Is capitalism realism real? | |

### Spectulative designs
For this exerciese I'll take the question ***Where reality becomes real?*** as a resarch question. It addresses the physical dimension of reality, that related to the space we inhabit and which is conceived in our minds as a logical representation of cartesian coordinates and vectors, whilst is experienced from the physicality of our body. The question presupposes we have no certainty the reality we assume as real is real, we the speculative designs should consider it.

This set of mindful procedures guide all the aspects of everyday life. By following these good practices should practices in order to be aware and avoid buy a fake reality as a real reality.

## Ideation - Week 2

### Weekly experiment: 4 days out of social media
For this experiment I wanted to address some of the questions I have been aking myself during the last few weeks, some of them –that I wrote during class' 2 exercise– are: *can reality be composed by all realities at the same time?*, *can internet reproduce multiple realities at the same time?*, and *can different time realities –or time scales– occur simultaneously in one reality?*. As it can be seen, these questions set the focus on two aspects of reality: **time** –the nonspatial continuum in which events occur in apparently irreversible succession [(1)](https://www.wordnik.com/words/time), in which existence is measured, or the past, present, and future considered as a whole. [(2)](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/time)– and **the internet**. The idea of questioning internet's role on the mediation of our reality –wether it is by the overflooding of content through social media and news broadcast services, or by simply because it particularly calls our attention abstracting us from our reality– popped up after reading an [article](https://www.wired.com/story/mirrorworld-ar-next-big-tech-platform/) published by Wired that talks about the *mirrorworld*. 

The mirrorworld, according to that publication, is a digital mapping of the real world where every element has its own 3D twin, from streets to animals to people. It is pretty much the materialization –ironically within internet's immeterial environment– of the idea of hyperreality proposed by Baudrillard –inspired in Borges' *On Exactitude in Science* fable–: a 3D simulacrum of the world on real scale with detailed enough quality to feed 3D engines in real time for augmentation or synthesis of realities. Since the internet stores –and thus, contains– all realities feed to it, the mirrorworld can also be all realities at the same time, like a [hypercube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube) –geometrically speaking– or like Borges' Library of Babel. In this regard a story built on time is not linear anymore, because multiple stories happen on space and time simultaneusly, thus we can speak of a *hypercube of realities*.
