# Thesis Documentation
*Guillermo Montecinos*

*ITP Spring 2020*

## Portfolio - Week 0
From the work I've done in ITP, three projects are important to me regarding the concepts and techniques I merged.

### Generative Major Arcana
This project is an exploration of how IA algorithms generate random patterns based on a dataset –in this case of images– and how this outcome can be assigned with meanind by the association with already known symbols. In this project I gathered a dataset of Major Arcana cards scraped from Google Images and used them to train a a DCGAN model, that was run to generate *new cards*.

Further information on this project can be found on its complete [documentation](https://github.com/guillemontecinos/itp_spring_2019_electronic_rituals/blob/master/meditation_2/meditation_2.md).

### sonAR
This project may be the starting point of my thesis. It is an AR spatial sound app in which physical elements can be spawned in space and react to the ambient sound as well as act as sound sources. This project attempted to explore how users can interact with sound elements that exist in an intermediate layer between the real world and our perception.

Further information of this project can be found on its [documentation](https://guillemontecinos.cl/portfolio/sonar/).

### Dead Man Walking
This project was my first AR production using Unity. In this project I learned the foundations of AR in Unity and its limitations, and I also learned how to develop a storytelling-based experience using XR technologies. Please check out my [portfolio page](https://guillemontecinos.cl/portfolio/dead-man-walking/) for further information.

## Ideation - Week 1
### Mind-map and question
During the first week we were commited to think about our thesis topic and develop some exercises based on it. The first exercise we were asked to do was to write a mind map that connected all conecpts related to our topic, and that would allow us to write a reearch question. The concept I picked to develop the map was *Reality*, since I have had lots of troubles with it since I've been experiencing the political process of Chile through the different media options offered by my mobile phone and laptop. In this sence, the idea of reality collapses because my current reality, NYC, is oppossed to Chile's reality, that I see *experience* mediated. Becasue of the above, I built the following mind-map:

The topic is too broad, and I have no understanding yet to destillate it into only one question. Instead, I decided to exercise writting a bunch of question that could start from a general query to a more specific one, in order to walk through my ideas towards a few questions that could represent my topic of interes.

#### First round of questions
|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
| Day dreaming                                                          | Where reality becaomes reality?                                               | Can something be my reality –or can I be part of its reality– only because I imagined it? |

| Santiag/Plaza de la Dignidad faded out                                | In the boundary between our body and the space?                               | Does it make senes to talk about what is real or what is not? |
| It is not there because i am not there                                | Or inside our minds?                                                          | Is Santiago still located at -33.437º, -70,634º even I don't see it throught my eyes? |
| Doesn't exist because I don't experience it                           | Can reality be more than only one?                                            | Can be my sister and parents laying to me and faking Santiago is still there? |
| I live a simulation of that reality that I imagine and scroll down    | Can many realities coexist in the same time/space?                            | Is it possible that Google Maps creates a new instance of the class 'Santiago' every time I click on it in the browser? |
|                                                                       | Is the moon's landscape my reality while I live in NYC?                       | |

#### Second round of questions
|   |   |
|---|---|
| Is our political organization real? or are we ina  simulacrum of politcal order? | Is capitalism real becaus it governs the space we move in or because it governs the realationships between our ideas inside our minds? |
| Do we perform everyday that we are citizens and belong to a super-structure that governs us? | Does capitalism exist in the layer when our body ends and the outer space begins? |
| Can be a new constitution real? | Can capitalism exist in an infinitesimal layer between two bodies? |
| Is the current constitution real? | Is capitalism cannot survive between two bodies, why can it exist in a society? |
| Are the powers that co-opt us real? | Are we a society? |
| Is the police real? | Are we connected and aggloremated by invisible forces like magnetism? |
| Are police men and women simulating they detent a power given by the society? | Who can ensure me that all this is not a simulacrum without pointing out movies like the matrix and inception? |
| Is that society even real? | |
| Is capitalism real? | |
| Is capitalism realism real? | |
